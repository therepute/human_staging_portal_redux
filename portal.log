For example, in the case of a plant, AI could predict growing demand for a certain type of seasonal shrub and increase its orders as interest rises, then place the plants in the most obvious in-store location.\n\nIn the case of hurricane preparedness, sudden weather changes can be taken into account to order larger volumes of flashlights and weather radios. And plumbing items may be placed closer to the front of the store for leaks that require emergency attention during harsh and unpredictable seasons.\n\nChandhu Nair, the senior vice president of data, AI, and innovation at Lowe\'s, told Business Insider that the technology is allowing the store chain to create more immersive shopping experiences that are also easy and quick to navigate.\n\nThis effort is being driven by front-of-house retail staff and white-collar workers behind the scenes, who are ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces their jobs.\n\nA team-wide effort\nNair said that delivering a "simpler, faster, and more fun" physical retail experience requires large volumes of real-world data, like "store traffic patterns" and "local preferences," provided by store associates and customers. It also needs the right tools for Lowe\'s spatial planning teams to extract meaningful insights from it, he added.\n\nPreviously, these teams relied largely on manual processes for collecting this information, analyzing it, and putting the insights into practice. Consequently, Nair said it could take months for Lowe\'s to see any meaningful results. But AI-powered spatial intelligence systems have reduced this to "a fraction of that time."\n\nNair said this is paramount because new product trends are always emerging and disappearing, especially because of social media apps like TikTok. He said, "We can now swap layouts more frequently throughout the year, reflecting what customers in that area need at that time."\n\nBesides spatial intelligence and data analysis tools, Lowe\'s is also exploring the potential of digital twins ‚Äî a piece of software that generates a virtual version of a physical environment, such as a retail store. Nair said the company has used Nvidia\'s 3D graphics platform, Omniverse, to create an early-stage app that offers sales and inventory data, automatically sorts stock, generates 3D versions of its physical assets, and more from a single platform.\n\nIf it ultimately gets adopted, "It would give merchants a way to test and refine layouts digitally before making changes in-store, helping surface the most relevant products in ways that align with how local customers shop," he told BI.\n\nAI for smarter shopping\nLowe\'s isn\'t the only retailer that believes in the potential of AI. Research from Honeywell, a multinational conglomerate, found that 80% of retailers will acquire AI systems over the coming months to better understand customers, create a more efficient shopping experience, and improve worker productivity.\n\nComputer vision models, in particular, can also offer a lot of potential for retailers. Vinod Goje, a software engineering leader and AI solutions strategist, told BI that such systems are capable of generating heat maps that signal parts of the store with the most and least foot traffic, allowing workers to place products and design retail layouts more strategically.\n\nGoje added that retailers can also install computer vision systems on shelves to ensure products are in the right place and replenished when stock runs low. The tech can also work with AI to show customers personalized offers on in-store smart screens, he said.\n\nIn the future, agentic AI systems, which are designed to make decisions independent of humans, could disrupt the retail sector even further. Sucharita Kodali, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, told BI that AI agents could find people to fill in for ill employees, order merchandise when stock levels are low, and develop marketing plans in line with available stock.\n\nChallenges to consider\nOf course, as retailers like Lowe\'s become more reliant on AI to improve efficiencies, concerns are growing that the technology could wipe out millions of blue-collar jobs in the next few years. That said, Nair emphasized that Lowe\'s approach is to augment staff and not put them out of work; using AI for store-layout optimization requires "human creativity," he said, in addition to "data-powered insights" and "efficient technology."\n\nAmid concerns about AI adoption, Nair emphasized that the company isn\'t using "technology for technology\'s sake," but rather focusing on solutions that address staff\'s biggest pain points, based on feedback from in-store and e-commerce teams.\n\nLooking ahead\nAlthough many of Lowe\'s AI projects are still in their infancy, Nair is optimistic about their role in the century-old retailer\'s future. He said his team will continue to "get better at connecting insights and predictions" to "adapt stores even faster" and create "smarter and more personal" experiences for its loyal customers.\n\nTo do this, Nair and his team will continue to experiment with new AI tools, improve them through "quicker feedback loops," and strive to create "a high-value retail experience that keeps evolving with our customers."\n\nHe told BI, "We\'re excited about what\'s ahead and how AI will help us keep solving problems and fulfilling dreams for the home."', 'publication': 'Business Insider Markets', 'date': '2025-07-18', 'story_link': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/lowes-ai-retail-store-layout-product-trends-customer-experience-2025-7', 'search': 'businessinsider', 'source': None, 'client_priority': 1, 'pub_tier': 4, 'duration_sec': None}

For example, in the case of a plant, AI could predict growing demand for a certain type of seasonal shrub and increase its orders as interest rises, then place the plants in the most obvious in-store location.\n\nIn the case of hurricane preparedness, sudden weather changes can be taken into account to order larger volumes of flashlights and weather radios. And plumbing items may be placed closer to the front of the store for leaks that require emergency attention during harsh and unpredictable seasons.\n\nChandhu Nair, the senior vice president of data, AI, and innovation at Lowe\'s, told Business Insider that the technology is allowing the store chain to create more immersive shopping experiences that are also easy and quick to navigate.\n\nThis effort is being driven by front-of-house retail staff and white-collar workers behind the scenes, who are ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces their jobs.\n\nA team-wide effort\nNair said that delivering a "simpler, faster, and more fun" physical retail experience requires large volumes of real-world data, like "store traffic patterns" and "local preferences," provided by store associates and customers. It also needs the right tools for Lowe\'s spatial planning teams to extract meaningful insights from it, he added.\n\nPreviously, these teams relied largely on manual processes for collecting this information, analyzing it, and putting the insights into practice. Consequently, Nair said it could take months for Lowe\'s to see any meaningful results. But AI-powered spatial intelligence systems have reduced this to "a fraction of that time."\n\nNair said this is paramount because new product trends are always emerging and disappearing, especially because of social media apps like TikTok. He said, "We can now swap layouts more frequently throughout the year, reflecting what customers in that area need at that time."\n\nBesides spatial intelligence and data analysis tools, Lowe\'s is also exploring the potential of digital twins ‚Äî a piece of software that generates a virtual version of a physical environment, such as a retail store. Nair said the company has used Nvidia\'s 3D graphics platform, Omniverse, to create an early-stage app that offers sales and inventory data, automatically sorts stock, generates 3D versions of its physical assets, and more from a single platform.\n\nIf it ultimately gets adopted, "It would give merchants a way to test and refine layouts digitally before making changes in-store, helping surface the most relevant products in ways that align with how local customers shop," he told BI.\n\nAI for smarter shopping\nLowe\'s isn\'t the only retailer that believes in the potential of AI.

For example, in the case of a plant, AI could predict growing demand for a certain type of seasonal shrub and increase its orders as interest rises, then place the plants in the most obvious in-store location.\n\nIn the case of hurricane preparedness, sudden weather changes can be taken into account to order larger volumes of flashlights and weather radios. And plumbing items may be placed closer to the front of the store for leaks that require emergency attention during harsh and unpredictable seasons.\n\nChandhu Nair, the senior vice president of data, AI, and innovation at Lowe\'s, told Business Insider that the technology is allowing the store chain to create more immersive shopping experiences that are also easy and quick to navigate.\n\nThis effort is being driven by front-of-house retail staff and white-collar workers behind the scenes, who are ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces their jobs.\n\nA team-wide effort\nNair said that delivering a "simpler, faster, and more fun" physical retail experience requires large volumes of real-world data, like "store traffic patterns" and "local preferences," provided by store associates and customers. It also needs the right tools for Lowe\'s spatial planning teams to extract meaningful insights from it, he added.\n\nPreviously, these teams relied largely on manual processes for collecting this information, analyzing it, and putting the insights into practice. Consequently, Nair said it could take months for Lowe\'s to see any meaningful results. But AI-powered spatial intelligence systems have reduced this to "a fraction of that time."\n\nNair said this is paramount because new product trends are always emerging and disappearing, especially because of social media apps like TikTok. He said, "We can now swap layouts more frequently throughout the year, reflecting what customers in that area need at that time."\n\nBesides spatial intelligence and data analysis tools, Lowe\'s is also exploring the potential of digital twins ‚Äî a piece of software that generates a virtual version of a physical environment, such as a retail store. Nair said the company has used Nvidia\'s 3D graphics platform, Omniverse, to create an early-stage app that offers sales and inventory data, automatically sorts stock, generates 3D versions of its physical assets, and more from a single platform.\n\nIf it ultimately gets adopted, "It would give merchants a way to test and refine layouts digitally before making changes in-store, helping surface the most relevant products in ways that align with how local customers shop," he told BI.\n\nAI for smarter shopping\nLowe\'s isn\'t the only retailer that believes in the potential of AI. Research from Honeywell, a multinational conglomerate, found that 80% of retailers will acquire AI systems over the coming months to better understand customers, create a more efficient shopping experience, and improve worker productivity.\n\nComputer vision models, in particular, can also offer a lot of potential for retailers. Vinod Goje, a software engineering leader and AI solutions strategist, told BI that such systems are capable of generating heat maps that signal parts of the store with the most and least foot traffic, allowing workers to place products and design retail layouts more strategically.\n\nGoje added that retailers can also install computer vision systems on shelves to ensure products are in the right place and replenished when stock runs low. The tech can also work with AI to show customers personalized offers on in-store smart screens, he said.\n\nIn the future, agentic AI systems, which are designed to make decisions independent of humans, could disrupt the retail sector even further. Sucharita Kodali, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, told BI that AI agents could find people to fill in for ill employees, order merchandise when stock levels are low, and develop marketing plans in line with available stock.\n\nChallenges to consider\nOf course, as retailers like Lowe\'s become more reliant on AI to improve efficiencies, concerns are growing that the technology could wipe out millions of blue-collar jobs in the next few years.

Vinod Goje, a software engineering leader and AI solutions strategist, told BI that such systems are capable of generating heat maps that signal parts of the store with the most and least foot traffic, allowing workers to place products and design retail layouts more strategically.\n\nGoje added that retailers can also install computer vision systems on shelves to ensure products are in the right place and replenished when stock runs low. The tech can also work with AI to show customers personalized offers on in-store smart screens, he said.\n\nIn the future, agentic AI systems, which are designed to make decisions independent of humans, could disrupt the retail sector even further. Sucharita Kodali, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, told BI that AI agents could find people to fill in for ill employees, order merchandise when stock levels are low, and develop marketing plans in line with available stock.\n\nChallenges to consider\nOf course, as retailers like Lowe\'s become more reliant on AI to improve efficiencies, concerns are growing that the technology could wipe out millions of blue-collar jobs in the next few years. That said, Nair emphasized that Lowe\'s approach is to augment staff and not put them out of work; using AI for store-layout optimization requires "human creativity," he said, in addition to "data-powered insights" and "efficient technology."\n\nAmid concerns about AI adoption, Nair emphasized that the company isn\'t using "technology for technology\'s sake," but rather focusing on solutions that address staff\'s biggest pain points, based on feedback from in-store and e-commerce teams.\n\nLooking ahead\nAlthough many of Lowe\'s AI projects are still in their infancy, Nair is optimistic about their role in the century-old retailer\'s future. He said his team will continue to "get better at connecting insights and predictions" to "adapt stores even faster" and create "smarter and more personal" experiences for its loyal customers.\n\nTo do this, Nair and his team will continue to experiment with new AI tools, improve them through "quicker feedback loops," and strive to create "a high-value retail experience that keeps evolving with our customers."\n\nHe told BI, "We\'re excited about what\'s ahead and how AI will help us keep solving problems and fulfilling dreams for the home."', 'Story_Link': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/lowes-ai-retail-store-layout-product-trends-customer-experience-2025-7', 'Search': 'businessinsider', 'Headline - Length - Words': None, 'Body - Length - Words': None, 'Pre_Check_Null_Values': None, 'Prep_Identify_Duplicate_Syndicate': None, 'Prep_Catalog_Unfamiliar_Publications': None, 'Prep_Normalize_Publication_Titles': None, 'Prep_Assign_Quality_Scores': None, 'AI - Analysis - Results1': None, 'AI - Analysis - Results2': None, 'Pub_Tier': None, 'Pub_Multiplier': None, 'Pub_Type': None, 'Pub_Sub_Type': None, 'O_Desc': None, 'Input_Source': None, 'orgs': None, 'people': None, 'in_name': None, 'in_prom': None, 'tp_name': None, 'tp_prom': None, 'nar': None, 'fact': None, 'C_Uber_prom': None, 'C_Uber_context': None, 'C_Sonos_prom': None, 'C_Sonos_context': None, 'C_Lyft_prom': None, 'C_Lyft_context': None, 'C_United_prom': None, 'C_United_context': None, 'Routing_Status': None, 'Routing_Targets': None, 'Last_Routed': None, 'Last Modified By': None, 'id': 5405, 'Source': None, 'client_priority': 1, 'headline_relevance': None, 'access_available': None, 'extraction_path': None, 'created_at': None, 'source_url': None, 'scraper_id': None, 'assigned_at': None, 'submitted_at': None, 'duration_sec': None, 'subscription': 0, 'soup_dedupe_id': 'SF_20250718_193202_000001', 'clients': None, 'focus_industry': None, 'is_analysis': False, 'last_modified_at': '2025-08-14T20:01:44.752938+00:00'}]

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\nU.S. export policy around advanced semiconductors ‚Äî particularly Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and Blackwell-class AI chips ‚Äî has created a growing debate about how to balance national security and economic competitiveness. None of this is new to me, as I dealt with export controls during my time at AMD and have written about earlier export restrictions placed on Nvidia by the U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security. (Note that Nvidia is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\n\nIn short, I support allowing Nvidia to sell the H20 and future de-tuned Blackwell variants directly to China for non-military use. Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\n\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I‚Äôve publicly said that it‚Äôs better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei‚Äôs ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech ‚Äî witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards ‚Äî not Chinese ones ‚Äî define the next wave of global AI.\n\nBackground: U.S. Export Controls And The H20 GPU\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the ‚ÄúAI Diffusion Rule.‚Äù These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia‚Äôs A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware. Nvidia‚Äôs H100, H200 and other advanced GPUs were blocked, but the H20 was designed to comply with the new rules with plenty of room to spare ‚Äî falling well within the thresholds of the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù and thus not requiring a license or notice before shipping. While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nThe Prompt: Get the week‚Äôs biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nThe Prompt: Get the week‚Äôs biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\nU.S. export policy around advanced semiconductors ‚Äî particularly Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and Blackwell-class AI chips ‚Äî has created a growing debate about how to balance national security and economic competitiveness. None of this is new to me, as I dealt with export controls during my time at AMD and have written about earlier export restrictions placed on Nvidia by the U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security. (Note that Nvidia is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\n\nIn short, I support allowing Nvidia to sell the H20 and future de-tuned Blackwell variants directly to China for non-military use. Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\n\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I‚Äôve publicly said that it‚Äôs better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei‚Äôs ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech ‚Äî witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards ‚Äî not Chinese ones ‚Äî define the next wave of global AI.\n\nBackground: U.S. Export Controls And The H20 GPU\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the ‚ÄúAI Diffusion Rule.‚Äù These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia‚Äôs A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware.

None of this is new to me, as I dealt with export controls during my time at AMD and have written about earlier export restrictions placed on Nvidia by the U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security. (Note that Nvidia is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\n\nIn short, I support allowing Nvidia to sell the H20 and future de-tuned Blackwell variants directly to China for non-military use. Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\n\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I‚Äôve publicly said that it‚Äôs better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei‚Äôs ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech ‚Äî witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards ‚Äî not Chinese ones ‚Äî define the next wave of global AI.\n\nBackground: U.S. Export Controls And The H20 GPU\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the ‚ÄúAI Diffusion Rule.‚Äù These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia‚Äôs A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware. Nvidia‚Äôs H100, H200 and other advanced GPUs were blocked, but the H20 was designed to comply with the new rules with plenty of room to spare ‚Äî falling well within the thresholds of the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù and thus not requiring a license or notice before shipping. While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nThe Prompt: Get the week‚Äôs biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nThe Prompt: Get the week‚Äôs biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

"We remain committed to providing the most secure services possible to the US government, including working with our national security partners to evaluate and adjust our security protocols as needed."', 'Story_Link': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-probe-microsofts-use-chinese-engineers-sensitive-defense-systems-hegseth-says', 'Search': 'foxnews', 'Headline - Length - Words': None, 'Body - Length - Words': None, 'Pre_Check_Null_Values': None, 'Prep_Identify_Duplicate_Syndicate': None, 'Prep_Catalog_Unfamiliar_Publications': None, 'Prep_Normalize_Publication_Titles': None, 'Prep_Assign_Quality_Scores': None, 'AI - Analysis - Results1': None, 'AI - Analysis - Results2': None, 'Pub_Tier': None, 'Pub_Multiplier': None, 'Pub_Type': None, 'Pub_Sub_Type': None, 'O_Desc': None, 'Input_Source': None, 'orgs': None, 'people': None, 'in_name': None, 'in_prom': None, 'tp_name': None, 'tp_prom': None, 'nar': None, 'fact': None, 'C_Uber_prom': None, 'C_Uber_context': None, 'C_Sonos_prom': None, 'C_Sonos_context': None, 'C_Lyft_prom': None, 'C_Lyft_context': None, 'C_United_prom': None, 'C_United_context': None, 'Routing_Status': None, 'Routing_Targets': None, 'Last_Routed': None, 'Last Modified By': None, 'id': 5409, 'Source': None, 'client_priority': 1, 'headline_relevance': None, 'access_available': None, 'extraction_path': None, 'created_at': None, 'source_url': None, 'scraper_id': None, 'assigned_at': None, 'submitted_at': None, 'duration_sec': None, 'subscription': 0, 'soup_dedupe_id': 'SF_20250718_195124_000001', 'clients': None, 'focus_industry': None, 'is_analysis': False, 'last_modified_at': '2025-08-14T20:04:50.411287+00:00'}]

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\nU.S. export policy around advanced semiconductors ‚Äî particularly Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and Blackwell-class AI chips ‚Äî has created a growing debate about how to balance national security and economic competitiveness. None of this is new to me, as I dealt with export controls during my time at AMD and have written about earlier export restrictions placed on Nvidia by the U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security. (Note that Nvidia is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\n\nIn short, I support allowing Nvidia to sell the H20 and future de-tuned Blackwell variants directly to China for non-military use. Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\n\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I‚Äôve publicly said that it‚Äôs better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei‚Äôs ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech ‚Äî witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards ‚Äî not Chinese ones ‚Äî define the next wave of global AI.\n\nBackground: U.S. Export Controls And The H20 GPU\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the ‚ÄúAI Diffusion Rule.‚Äù These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia‚Äôs A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware. Nvidia‚Äôs H100, H200 and other advanced GPUs were blocked, but the H20 was designed to comply with the new rules with plenty of room to spare ‚Äî falling well within the thresholds of the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù and thus not requiring a license or notice before shipping. While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nCareers: Land the job, get a raise and learn to lead with our weekly Careers newsletter.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\n\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I‚Äôve publicly said that it‚Äôs better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei‚Äôs ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech ‚Äî witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards ‚Äî not Chinese ones ‚Äî define the next wave of global AI.\n\nBackground: U.S. Export Controls And The H20 GPU\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the ‚ÄúAI Diffusion Rule.‚Äù These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia‚Äôs A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware. Nvidia‚Äôs H100, H200 and other advanced GPUs were blocked, but the H20 was designed to comply with the new rules with plenty of room to spare ‚Äî falling well within the thresholds of the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù and thus not requiring a license or notice before shipping. While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nCareers: Land the job, get a raise and learn to lead with our weekly Careers newsletter.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\nU.S. export policy around advanced semiconductors ‚Äî particularly Nvidia‚Äôs H20 and Blackwell-class AI chips ‚Äî has created a growing debate about how to balance national security and economic competitiveness. None of this is new to me, as I dealt with export controls during my time at AMD and have written about earlier export restrictions placed on Nvidia by the U.S. Department of Commerce‚Äôs Bureau of Industry and Security. (Note that Nvidia is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\n\nIn short, I support allowing Nvidia to sell the H20 and future de-tuned Blackwell variants directly to China for non-military use. Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\n\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I‚Äôve publicly said that it‚Äôs better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei‚Äôs ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech ‚Äî witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards ‚Äî not Chinese ones ‚Äî define the next wave of global AI.\n\nBackground: U.S. Export Controls And The H20 GPU\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the ‚ÄúAI Diffusion Rule.‚Äù These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia‚Äôs A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware. Nvidia‚Äôs H100, H200 and other advanced GPUs were blocked, but the H20 was designed to comply with the new rules with plenty of room to spare ‚Äî falling well within the thresholds of the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù and thus not requiring a license or notice before shipping. While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nCareers: Land the job, get a raise and learn to lead with our weekly Careers newsletter.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.

While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden‚Äôs Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia ‚Äúcan, will and should sell AI chips‚Äù such as the H20 ‚Äî while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an ‚Äúis informed‚Äù letter ‚Äî not a regulation ‚Äî instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Biggest Battery Yet Claimed In New Leak\n\nExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air And iPhone 17 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro And iPhone 16 Pro Max Prices Slashed Further In Major Sale On Now\n\n\nIn the wake of the U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration‚Äôs ‚Äî which allowed sales without any notice ‚Äî but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China‚Äôs national champion, Huawei.\n\nCriticism Of Nvidia Exports ‚Äî Versus The Reality I See\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it‚Äôs bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei‚Äôs domestic alternatives.\n\nCareers: Land the job, get a raise and learn to lead with our weekly Careers newsletter.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates‚Äô offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\nSign Up\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China‚Äôs own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS ‚Äúgreen zone,‚Äù H20s are already available to CSPs in China ‚Äî as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs ‚Äî based in the U.S. or allied nations ‚Äî that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\n\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE ‚Äî such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus ‚Äî are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia‚Äôs new B300 world.\n\nAs for the ‚Äúbad business for Nvidia‚Äù part, it‚Äôs important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia‚Äôs manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies ‚Äî and not just Nvidia ‚Äî of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn‚Äôt go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world ‚Äî as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\n\nThe KYC-Controlled Export Model\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips ‚Äî they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\n\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, ‚ÄúJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that‚Äôs winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we‚Äôre in big trouble.‚Äù\n\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\n\nStrategic And Economic Considerations\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia‚Äôs ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack ‚Äî Huawei‚Äôs response to Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA stack ‚Äî is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\n\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia‚Äôs technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\n\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms ‚Äî or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\n\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric ‚Äî because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\n\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\n\nCompete With Common-Sense Restrictions, Don‚Äôt Concede Global Market Share To China\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market ‚Äî particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests ‚Äî only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China‚Äôs AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\n\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle ‚Äî preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\n\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.
